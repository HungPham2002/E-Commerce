# Hello, 
This is my Ecommerce project, I build to only research and learn about machine learning. Deep learning model notebook as extra (Deep neural is a complicated process. in reality, simple things is usually more effective), I have not understood it yet. I'm not sure it work correctly and effectively. Maybe it overfit and I do not see that :DD
# Customer Churn Prediction 
## Context
In today's highly competitive business landscape, retaining customers is crucial for the success of an organization. A customer churn prediction model using various machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, random forest, Decision Tree
## Dataset: 
  - Content
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

  - The data set includes information about:
    + Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
    + Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

## Note
+ those Lib without in colab just are used for visualizing data and visualizing evaluation or Interact between features. If only training model you can ignore that step because it install and we restart time and rerun -> wasting time :V
+ In Ecommerce project, We requied to create a dashboard to visualize data. this is the URL to Dashboard project: https://github.com/HungPham2002/Dashboard_ECommerce
